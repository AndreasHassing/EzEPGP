Project Name:
ezEPGP - https://github.com/AndreasHassing/EzEPGP

Project Description:
Hey everyone! This is an alternative to webEPGP, if you want to host your
EPGP on your own website. This system also allows full customization, as
I won't come running if you change anything, it's basically free-to-abuse.

There is one thing though, I'd love it if you left the link to my personal
blog on the script  ():3

I have tons of ideas for this side-project, so stay tuned :)

------------------

Installing:
'OMG WHY ARE THERE NO INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS1?
Because, at this point the ezEPGP is only capable of pushing json data to
your database. And that's not very interesting. Stay tuned!


------------------

Patch Notes:
---
v0.3a - ??/??/2011
~ COMING!!
~ Going to add a EPGP-viewer in a table, with some easy-to-use css styling.
~ Optimization of json parsing, so that you obtain more information about
  what is currently being parsed, and on-finish information.

---
v0.2a - 16/08/2011
+ Finished up the json parsing script. ezEPGP now obtains the ep+gp+pr and
  latest loot information from the json dump.
+ Fixed the database duplicates, and added a 'existing user' check before
  query.
  
---
v0.1a - 15/08/2011
+ Made everything up to this point.
