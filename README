Project Name:
ezEPGP - https://github.com/AndreasHassing/EzEPGP

Project Description:
Hey everyone! This is an alternative to webEPGP, if you want to host your
EPGP on your own website. This system also allows full customization, as
I won't come running if you change anything, it's basically free-to-abuse.

There is one thing though, I'd love it if you left the link to my personal
blog on the script  ():3

I have tons of ideas for this side-project, so stay tuned :)

------------------

Installing:
'OMG WHY ARE THERE NO INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS1?
Because, at this point the ezEPGP is only capable of pushing json data to
your database. And that's not very interesting. Stay tuned!


------------------

Patch Notes:
---
v0.2a - ??/??/2011
~ COMING UP! 
  Going to start on json parsing and storing wowhead data in the database.
  
---
v0.1a - 15/08/2011
~ Made everything up to this point.
