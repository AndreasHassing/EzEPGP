Project Name:
ezEPGP - https://github.com/AndreasHassing/EzEPGP

Project Description:
Rewrote this entire project 2013. I'm not playing the game anymore, so might
as well release the best I have right now, and let the community have it.

------------------

Installing:
There is 1 file! Edit the variable names at the top of the PHP-part!

The $EPGP_URL is the URL of your RAW PasteBin. Take ours (Prowess) as an
example: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Ct0gatSH
It's the output the EPGP addon gives, and you throw that in an unlisted
PasteBin that you can edit later (put it on your account). After that
you're set, and the website will update it once pr. viewer once a day,
unless you specifically request a refresh like so:
yoursite.com/epgpviewer.php?reload=1 // that will force the program to
refresh with the latest data from pastebin.

Everything in the viewer is cached, so you'll only request characters and
pastebin data once pr. update and not pr. view.

N'joy!


------------------

Patch Notes:
v1.0 - 15/02/2013
~ Rewrote, and finished. Enjoy!

---
v0.3a - ??/??/2011
~ COMING!!
~ Going to add a EPGP-viewer in a table, with some easy-to-use css styling.
~ Optimization of json parsing, so that you obtain more information about
  what is currently being parsed, and on-finish information.

---
v0.2a - 16/08/2011
+ Finished up the json parsing script. ezEPGP now obtains the ep+gp+pr and
  latest loot information from the json dump.
+ Fixed the database duplicates, and added a 'existing user' check before
  query.
  
---
v0.1a - 15/08/2011
+ Made everything up to this point.
